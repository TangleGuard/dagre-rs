# Generated SVG Output

This directory contains SVG files generated by the Dagrers layout visualization examples.

## Generated Files

When you run `cargo run --example visualize_layout`, it creates SVG files showing different graph layouts:

- `simple_chain_(top-to-bottom).svg` - Linear sequence of connected nodes
- `diamond_pattern_(top-to-bottom).svg` - Diverge and converge pattern  
- `complex_dag_(top-to-bottom).svg` - Multi-level graph with crossing opportunities
- `wide_graph_(top-to-bottom).svg` - Graph with many parallel branches
- `complex_dag_(left-to-right).svg` - Same complex graph in left-to-right layout
- `tight_spacing.svg` - Layout with reduced node and rank spacing
- `wide_spacing.svg` - Layout with increased node and rank spacing

## Viewing the Files

You can open any `.svg` file in:
- Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Image viewers that support SVG
- Code editors with SVG preview
- Vector graphics software (Inkscape, Illustrator)

## What to Look For

When examining the generated layouts:

1. **Hierarchical Structure** - Nodes flow in the correct direction (top-to-bottom or left-to-right)
2. **Layer Organization** - Related nodes are properly grouped in layers
3. **Edge Routing** - Edges connect nodes correctly with directional arrows
4. **Crossing Minimization** - Edge crossings are minimized where possible
5. **Spacing** - Nodes have appropriate separation based on configuration
6. **Labels** - Each node shows its identifier clearly
7. **Layout Info** - Bottom of each SVG shows graph statistics

## Regenerating Files

To regenerate all SVG files:

```bash
cargo run --example visualize_layout
```

The files will be overwritten with fresh layout calculations.

## Note

These files are automatically generated and can be safely deleted. They will be recreated the next time you run the visualization example.
